Number of clusters is unknown but
- Even a single car repeated has 3 gaps
  wheel-wheel
  intra-car
  inter-car (maybe 2 if asymmetrical)
- We can assume no more than 3 car types in a train
- Can be asymmetrical
- Can be flipped in direction

Each cluster is not very big
- Limited by noise in peak detection
- Could model the noise as an unknown as well
