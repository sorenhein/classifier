----------
* Attempt to allow random deletions and insertions (a few)

* Some _N and _R trains are almost impossible to separate
  - ICE4_DEU_28 is probably symmetric, in fact?
  - ICE2_DEU_48 ditto?
  - ICE1_old_CHE_56 ditto? [delete?]
  - ICE4_DEU_28 and ICET_DEU_28 have extremely similar ratios

* In doc, make the comments from Train axles.xlsx

* Files to finish:
  SynthTrain cpp and h
  driver.cpp

* Delete Clusters (stash it in some other project?)

Overall algorithm
-----------------

* Peak _positions_: 
  - Just do double integral.
  - Maybe force to 0.
  - Find envelope.
  - Detect peak positions.

* Or some kind of zero-crossing detector

* Then run the train matcher.

* Then look for peaks in the right places
  - Scale by v and a and shift by d
  - Know where there are quiet intervals as well
  - Integrate up and down
  - Find envelope
  - Detect peak values

* Check against laser measurements!
