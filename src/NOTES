----------
Priorities:

* Sensor 31 segfaults

* driver.cpp to have clean modes controlled by args.cpp

* Add timers for peak detection

* Output should be a single comp.txt for all sensors together

* In Align, also look for shifts like this: 062493
        ref   our
  #68   2     1   We have one spurious peak, but we missed 2
  #66   2     1
  #48   1     1
  #31   2     1

* Statistics by sensor
* Statistics by true train type

* Maybe also detect single insertions/deletions in first and 
  second half of times?  Or detect morphologically in peaks?

----------
* Some _N and _R trains are almost impossible to separate
  - ICE4_DEU_28 is probably symmetric, in fact?
  - ICE2_DEU_48 ditto?
  - ICE1_old_CHE_56 ditto? [delete?]
  - ICE4_DEU_28 and ICET_DEU_28 have extremely similar ratios

* In doc, make the comments from Train axles.xlsx

* Files to finish:
  SynthTrain cpp and h
  driver.cpp

Overall algorithm
-----------------

* Check against laser measurements!
* Output a diagram with the wagons suggested
* throw/catch with error codes (like Build)
* Make independent of sample rate (other than Butterworth?)
* Use Butterworth instead of 1001-tap lowpass filter?
  - Move to less padding in SegQuiet back
* Implement displacement algorithms
  - Our integration
  - Some kind of scalar product
  - Estimate parameters of the flanks?  What kind of function?
